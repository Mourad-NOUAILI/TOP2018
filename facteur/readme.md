# Solving of the "Postman" problem with a DFS on a K12 graph

## Problem: (TOP2018's pre-selection contest)

A postman delivers mails as follows:
- He can start with any house.
- He delivers the mail of the next house, if and only if, its number is composed by at least one digit of the number of the previous house.

He wanna deliver the mails of these houses: 11, 29, 19, 36, 40, 44, 52, 61, 70, 74, 83, 47.

__How many houses at maximum, the postman can deliver their mails at one run ?__

## Reader's background (Yep, I mean you :) )

* Graph theory
* Depth First Search (DFS)
* C++

__```If you wann learn about graphs, please see my write up:``` [graph theory](../../../../Graph-theory)__ (In construction)

## The K12-graph

## Constraint
For each vertex _v_ in V, check all reachable vertices _i_, such _i_ has at lea√©st one digit of _v_.

For example, {11, 61, 36, 83} is a path.

## Create the input

First I create a [Python script](edges.py) to generate the input for our program.

Generated input: [input](input) 

This script will generate the file 'input' which will contains the input in this format:
  
```
line #1: two space seperated integers _12_ and _66_. _12_ is the number of vertices and _66_ the number of edges.
  
for the 66th next lines, we have two space seperated intgers in each line, which indicates the edge.
```
  
  
 ## Coding
 
 Coding a C++ program that for each vertex _v_ in the K12 graph, detect all reachable vertices that respect the constraint.
 
 __(Recall: the constraint is: _P = <v0 v1 v2 ... vn>_ is a accepeted path, iif _vi_ has at least one digit of _vi-1_, such _0 < i <= n_)__
 
 C++ Code: [C++ Program](facteur.cpp)
 
 The output: [output](output)
